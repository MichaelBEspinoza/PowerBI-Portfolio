# PowerBI-Portfolio

Welcome to my **Power BI Portfolio**!  
This repository showcases a collection of dashboards and analytics projects I created to practice and strengthen my skills in **data visualization**, **business intelligence**, and **data storytelling** using **Microsoft Power BI**.

Each project includes the Power BI file (*.pbix*), the dataset used, and a short explanation of the insights behind the dashboard.
